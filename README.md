This project is based on Image Steganography. For now I'm undecided on the various functions this project will have. But I'm thinking of adding the following functiosns to it : 
1. Image on Image Streganography
2. Text on Image Steganography
3. Audio on Audio Steganography
4. Text on Audio Steganography

I'll use simple algorithms or Deep learning or Machine Learning Algorithms on it. Lets see how it all goes.
